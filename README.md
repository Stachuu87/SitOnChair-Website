# SitOnChair-Website
Website project created on Coder's Lab Bootcamp

In this project I'm going to practice **HTML5** and **CSS3** features like:


_* box-model_
_* position absolute / relative_
_* float_
_* ::before, ::after pseudoelements_
_* :hover, :focus etc. pseudoclasses_
_and many many others..._


It will be pleasure to hear any comments about my code.
