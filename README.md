# SitOnChair-Website
Website project created on Coder's Lab Bootcamp

In this project I'm going to practice **HTML5** and **CSS3** features like:


_* box-model
* position absolute / relative
* float
* ::before, ::after pseudoelements
* :hover, :focus etc. pseudoclasses
and many many others..._


It will be pleasure to hear any comments about my code.
